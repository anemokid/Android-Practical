# Android-Practical

1. How many of the steps you were able to complete by the end of the exam
- I was able to complete multiple steps if not all of them. I tried to complete most steps.  
2. Which parts/concepts you found easy to implement, or felt you understood how to implement well
- I felt like the second user register part with SharedPreferences was extremely easy for me to implement and I felt that I 
understand how intents and starting activities works.
3. Which parts/concepts you found hard to implement, or felt you did not completely understand how to implement well
- I found it was har for me to implement Recycler Views and extremely more so difficult for me to implement Async Tasks. I know what 
methods I should use for AsyncTasks but I geniuenly was confused about how exactly I should write it.
